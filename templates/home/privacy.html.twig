        <p>According to the european general data protection regulation text of May 25th, 2022 (RGPD), 
        the information collected on the CritX's registration form is stored in an electronic file for internal 
        and confidential use at CritX.<br><br>

        The legal basis for processing is the performance of your consent, at the time of registration, as the information provided is necessary 
        for the use of the platform and participation in the community.<br><br>

        This includes users' comments and the potential use of personal data (such as email address and, optionally, a personal photo) 
        to enable interaction within the platform and improve user experience.<br>
        Your data will not be shared with third parties without your explicit consent, except where required by law.<br>
        Consent is obtained when you create an account or when you explicitly opt in for specific features.<br><br>
        
        You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing of your personal data, and object to processing 
        or withdraw consent at any time.<br>
